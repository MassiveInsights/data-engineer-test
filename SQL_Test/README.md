# Massive Insights SQL Test
Welcome to the SQL component of the Massive Insights data engineer test. While new technologies are emerging for data processing (ie. Spark etc.), SQL is still ubiquitous in the Data Engineering world, and we expect our data engineers to be experts.

The following test has been created on the famous Northwind database. Anyone coming from a SQL Server background should be familiar. The schema of this database is as follows:

2. Run the Create_northwind.sql script to create the Northwind schema and populate it with data
3. Open the file SQL_Questions.sql and answer the questions inline in that file.
4. Save the changes to SQL_Questions.sql and follow the instructions in the main README.md on how to submit your test
